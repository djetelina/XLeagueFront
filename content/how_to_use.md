## How to use

### Register and get vouch

To play league games, you have to be "vouched" - that means approved user. That way we can eliminate leavers and people that can't behave.

The league also requires you to be registered on <a href="https://gamesurge.net/createaccount/" target="_blank">GameSurge</a>.

### Use league

Enter your GameSurge nickname in your chat window and connect. When you connect, use <span class="code">/login &lt;GameSurgeNick&gt; &lt;GameSurgePassword&gt;</span> to identify with the network. Bot will not recognize your commands otherwise.

Chat commands to control joining and leaving queue are below the input bar. The others can be found in the right sidebar.

When a queue with you is filled, the bot will PM you with a password

### Request vouch

*You NEED to have a registered GameSurge account in order to receive vouch!*
