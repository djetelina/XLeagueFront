## How to use

To use XLeague, you need to be vouched on XLeague and registered on <a href="https://gamesurge.net/createaccount/" target="_blank">GameSurge</a>.

Enter your GameSurge nickname in your chat window and connect. When you connect, use <span class="code">/login &lt;GameSurgeNick&gt; &lt;GameSurgePassword&gt;</span> to identify with the network. Bot will not recognize your commands otherwise.

Chat commands to control joining and leaving queue are below the input bar. The others can be found in the right sidebar.

### Getting vouched

To simplify usage of XLeague, we want to phase out registering to a forum.

When you first connect to the chat, just ask for a judge, if one is available, PM him (click on his name on the right and press PM), introduce yourself and ask for a vouch.

*You NEED to be logged in to your GameSurge account in order to receive vouch!*
